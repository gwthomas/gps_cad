Log of how successful the gear experiments were (using full trajectory)

Gear_experiment_1
(Learned pretty shaky dynamics, a lot of wildly waving....)
Iteration 10: 2 / 5 
Iteration 11: 3 / 5
Iteration 12: 4 / 5
Iteration 13: 4 / 5
Left it running - was a lot less shaky except for the beginning of the trajectory (kind of by iteration 28)
Iteration 30: 4 / 5

Gear_experiment_2
Cost has gone pretty steadily down from iterations 0-9 but still stuck in a local minima
Around iteration 10 begins to be able to put the gear on the pole
Iteration 11: 4 / 5
Iteration 12: 5 / 5
Iteration 14: 5 / 5
